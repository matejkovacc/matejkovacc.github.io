## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="matejkovac.jpg">

Hi there. I am a second year freshman at Faculty of Electric Engineering of the University Ljubljana. 

In this jekyll based resume you will get to know some facts about me. 

## Research Interest

I specialize myself into researching the effects of seismic movements on radioactive radiation in the vicinity of Nuclear powerplant KrÅ¡ko in Slovenia. If I recall, when I was a child, I was always fascinated by large earthquakes that seemed so powerful and unstoppable. On the other hand radioacive radiation brought my attention in highschool.
